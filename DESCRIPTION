Description: A collection of functions that allow users to generate synthetic
    data of known data types, with known associations among the elements in the
    dataset. This includes the ability to generate data frames with variables
    with known distributions, known correlation structures, and with variables
    as numeric, nominal, or ordinal types. Additionally, users can rescale
    variables to make them reflect meaningful real world data. Particularly
    useful for building reproducible test datasets during package development.
