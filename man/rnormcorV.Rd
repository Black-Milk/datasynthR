\title{Generate a vector from a normal distribution correlated with another distribution}
\usage{
rnormcorV(x, rho, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{variable to draw from}

\item{rho}{correlation coefficient between x and result of function}
}
\value{
a vector of the same length as x drawn from a normal distribution correlated with x at the level of rho
}
\description{
Allow user to draw from a random normal distribution correlated with a user specified vector
}
\details{
Rough estimate, biased by known amount for now
}
\examples{
x <- rnorm(1000, 1, 1)
y <- rnormcorV(x, 0.2)
cor(x,y) # very close to 0.2
mean(y) # close to 0
sd(y)   # close to 1
