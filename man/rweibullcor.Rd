\title{Generate a vector from a Weibull distribution correlated with another distribution}
\usage{
rweibullcor(x, rho, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{variable to draw from}

\item{rho}{correlation coefficient between x and result of function}

\item{na.rm}{a logical indicating whether to fit the distribution excluding missing values
or to fail on missing values}
}
\value{
a vector of the same length as x drawn from a normal distribution correlated with x at the level of rho
}
\description{
Allow user to draw from a Weibull distribution correlated with a user specified vector
}
\details{
Rough estimate
}
\examples{
x <- rnorm(1000)
y <- rweibullcor(x, 0.2)
cor(x,y) # very close to 0.2
mean(y)
sd(y)
}
